# Changelog

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Before 1.0 the minor
number carries breaking changes.

The version lives in `epubforge/__init__.py` and is the single source for
`pyproject.toml`, `epubforge --version`, the window title and the Windows
installer — bump it there and everything follows.

## 0.2.0

### Added
- Self-contained Windows build: PyInstaller distribution bundling the Python
  runtime, Qt, a jlink-built Java runtime and EPUBCheck, plus an Inno Setup
  installer and a portable ZIP. Nothing needs to be installed on the target
  machine.
- Polish interface with tooltips that describe what each option does to the
  book, and per-item tooltips on the rebuild modes.
- Fluent-flavoured styling with light and dark variants selected from the
  system palette.
- Repair of publisher CSS errors: `font-style`/`font-weight: regular`, which is
  not a CSS value and caused parsers to discard the whole declaration.
- Image-only paragraphs are opted out of body-text indentation and centred, so
  cover and title artwork is no longer shifted by rules meant for running text.
- Stylesheet findings are surfaced: reader-specific properties such as
  `adobe-hyphenate`, and font stacks that end without a generic family.
- `--strict` removes reader-specific CSS properties and out-of-flow positioning.

### Changed
- The report now accounts for structural work. Upgrading the package from
  EPUB 2 to 3.3, relocating files and generating a navigation document count as
  fixes; a real rebuild can no longer report "0 fixed".
- Media types the manifest declares incorrectly are reported rather than being
  corrected silently.
- The GUI gained a "Kept" column so deliberate deviations are visible without
  opening the report.

### Fixed
- Content documents recovered by the HTML parser serialised with an `html:`
  prefix on every element instead of a default namespace.
- Fragment identifiers in the navigation document and NCX were not remapped
  when the ids they pointed at had to be renamed.
- Spine-order filename prefixes accumulated (`0000-0000-…`) when a book was
  rebuilt more than once.

### Reverted
- Out-of-flow positioning is no longer stripped from reflowable books by
  default. A rule such as `div.dol { position: absolute; bottom: 0 }` pins a
  dedication to the foot of the page — that is a layout the publisher chose,
  not a defect, so it is now reported and kept unless `--strict` is used.

## 0.1.0

Initial version: reads any EPUB 2 or 3 into a format-neutral model and
regenerates a conforming EPUB 3.3 container from it — package document,
navigation, manifest, spine, filenames and ZIP layout. Legacy presentational
markup is translated to equivalent CSS rather than dropped, obfuscated fonts
are deobfuscated, and non-core image formats are transcoded with references
rewritten. DRM is detected and refused.
