# Changelog

Versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Before 1.0 the minor
number carries breaking changes.

The version lives in `epubforge/__init__.py` and is the single source for
`pyproject.toml`, `epubforge --version`, the window title and the Windows
installer — bump it there and everything follows.

## 0.4.0

Driven by three more real books: Casino Royale, and Preludium Fundacji before
and after a manual repair.

### Added
- Repair for a block-level box nested directly inside an inline one — a chapter
  heading built as `<h1><a><span style="display:block">…</span></a></h1>`. The
  block splits the inline into anonymous boxes and margins and centring then
  behave unpredictably; the wrapper is promoted to `inline-block`, which is a
  legal container in the same position.

### Fixed
- Undefined entities such as `&nbsp;` survived into the output. With
  `resolve_entities=False` lxml accepts them as entity nodes and the strict
  parse *succeeds*, so the fallback that rewrites them never ran — and the
  EPUB 3 `<!DOCTYPE html>` does not declare them, making readers fail fatally.
  Entities are now normalised before the strict parse rather than after it.
- `width="10%"` on an image is valid XHTML 1.1 but invalid XHTML 5, where the
  attribute must be a bare integer. Non-integer values move to CSS; integers
  stay as attributes.
- `remote-resources` was declared for documents whose only external reference
  was an ordinary hyperlink. The property covers resources a document embeds,
  not where its links point.
- Navigation entries pointing at a fragment that no longer exists now fall back
  to the document, instead of leaving a dangling anchor for validators.
- Image paragraphs already centred by a generic rule are no longer given a
  redundant inline style.

## 0.3.0

### Added
- EPUB Accessibility 1.1 discovery metadata (`schema:accessMode`,
  `accessModeSufficient`, `accessibilityFeature`, `accessibilityHazard`,
  `accessibilitySummary`), derived only from what the book demonstrably
  contains. Relevant since the European Accessibility Act began covering
  e-books in June 2025.
- Detection of alt text that merely repeats the filename (`alt="title-1"`,
  `alt="cover"`). It satisfies a validator and tells a screen-reader user
  nothing, so it does not count as a description and `alternativeText` is
  withheld.
- The cover image is described with the book's title instead of being left with
  a placeholder or an empty alt.
- Accessibility gaps a machine cannot fill — missing descriptions, skipped
  heading levels, tables without header cells — are reported as human work.
- `--claim-conformance {wcag-a,wcag-aa,wcag-aaa}` records the publisher's own
  conformance assertion. Never set automatically: WCAG cannot be established
  mechanically, and under the EAA the claim carries legal weight.
- `--no-a11y-metadata` to skip the declarations entirely.
- Interface language is switchable between Polish and English under
  Settings → Interface language, and remembered between runs.
- An About dialog naming the authors, the licence and the bundled components
  with their licences.
- Polish README, with the English one kept as `README.en.md`.

### Changed
- The image-paragraph correction now reads the CSS cascade before acting. A rule
  aimed at a paragraph by class or id — `p.ilustracja { text-align: right }` —
  is a decision about that image and is obeyed, while a blanket
  `p { text-align: justify }` written for prose is treated as inheritance that
  happens to land on the artwork. Inline styles are likewise respected. Books
  that style their images deliberately are therefore left alone; only pages
  where nothing decided the alignment are centred.

### Fixed
- The portable build showed no icon in the taskbar or window. PyInstaller's
  `icon=` only stamps the executable's resource, which is what Explorer draws;
  Qt needs the file at runtime, and Windows needs an explicit AppUserModelID or
  it groups the process under the host interpreter.

## 0.2.0

### Added
- Self-contained Windows build: PyInstaller distribution bundling the Python
  runtime, Qt, a jlink-built Java runtime and EPUBCheck, plus an Inno Setup
  installer and a portable ZIP. Nothing needs to be installed on the target
  machine.
- Polish interface with tooltips that describe what each option does to the
  book, and per-item tooltips on the rebuild modes.
- Fluent-flavoured styling with light and dark variants selected from the
  system palette.
- Repair of publisher CSS errors: `font-style`/`font-weight: regular`, which is
  not a CSS value and caused parsers to discard the whole declaration.
- Image-only paragraphs are opted out of body-text indentation and centred, so
  cover and title artwork is no longer shifted by rules meant for running text.
- Stylesheet findings are surfaced: reader-specific properties such as
  `adobe-hyphenate`, and font stacks that end without a generic family.
- `--strict` removes reader-specific CSS properties and out-of-flow positioning.

### Changed
- The report now accounts for structural work. Upgrading the package from
  EPUB 2 to 3.3, relocating files and generating a navigation document count as
  fixes; a real rebuild can no longer report "0 fixed".
- Media types the manifest declares incorrectly are reported rather than being
  corrected silently.
- The GUI gained a "Kept" column so deliberate deviations are visible without
  opening the report.

### Fixed
- Content documents recovered by the HTML parser serialised with an `html:`
  prefix on every element instead of a default namespace.
- Fragment identifiers in the navigation document and NCX were not remapped
  when the ids they pointed at had to be renamed.
- Spine-order filename prefixes accumulated (`0000-0000-…`) when a book was
  rebuilt more than once.

### Reverted
- Out-of-flow positioning is no longer stripped from reflowable books by
  default. A rule such as `div.dol { position: absolute; bottom: 0 }` pins a
  dedication to the foot of the page — that is a layout the publisher chose,
  not a defect, so it is now reported and kept unless `--strict` is used.

## 0.1.0

Initial version: reads any EPUB 2 or 3 into a format-neutral model and
regenerates a conforming EPUB 3.3 container from it — package document,
navigation, manifest, spine, filenames and ZIP layout. Legacy presentational
markup is translated to equivalent CSS rather than dropped, obfuscated fonts
are deobfuscated, and non-core image formats are transcoded with references
rewritten. DRM is detected and refused.
